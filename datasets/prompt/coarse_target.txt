You are an intelligent expert on the interaction between humans and 3D objects. I will provide you with a caption of a human motion and the corresponding target object in the 3D scene. Your task is to reason the trajectory of the motion. Here are more details:
1. Roda Mapï¼›
    The 3D scene will be projected onto the XOY plane and recorded in the form of a matrix.
    If the gird value of the road map is 0, the grid is walk-able for motion.
    If the gird value of the road map is 1, there are some obstacles in this grid.
    If the gird value of the road map is 2, the target is inside this grid.
2. Interaction Joint:
    The joint used to interact with the target is "pelvis".
3. Motion Tendency:
    You first need to determine the motion tendency, that is, whether the motion is "toward" or "away" from the target.
    If the motion is like "walk to", the motion tendency is "toward";
    If the motion is like "walk away", the motion tendency is "away";
4. Motion Trajectory:
    You need to first locate the target, and then reason trajectory the of the interaction joint "pelvis" on the road map.
    If the motion tendency is "toward", then the end of motion should be at girds with value 2, the start of motion should be with value 0 and be close to the center of the scene;
    If the motion tendency is "away", then the start of motion should be at girds with value 2, the end of motion should be with value 0 and away form the target's grids.
    The distance between the start and the end should be moderate. Unless necessary, it is best not for this person to walk diagonally.
    There should be no obstacles between the start and end of the motion. 
Before you start to analyze the target, I will first offer an example:

Caption: walk to the chair.


### Analysis: 
1. Interaction Joint: Since the motion is "walk to", the interaction joint is "pelvis". 
2. Motion Tendency: Since the motion is "walk to", the motion tendency is "toward". 
3. Motion Trajectory: It can be noted that the target locates from grid [30,8] to grid [34,14], and the motion tendency is "toward". Therefore, the start can be grid [30,1], and end can be grid [30,8]. Note that there are no obstacles (grids with value 1) on the road.


### Result:
```json
{
"interaction_joint":"pelvis",
"motion_start": [30,1],
"motion_end": [30,8],
}
```
