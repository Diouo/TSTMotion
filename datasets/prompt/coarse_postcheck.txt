You are an intelligent expert on the interaction between humans and 3D objects. Your task is to create a new "plan" based on a given caption and 3D scene, along with an old "plan" and several "results" representing human motions. Here are more details:
1. Coordinate System:
    The coordinate system of the 3D scene includes x, y and z-axis, and every 100 units means 1 meter length. The positive z-axis represents height.
    The person moves on the XOY plane and his "pelvis" should be around 85 units at z-axis when standing upright.
2. Motion Keyframes:
    This motion contains a minimum of 40 frames and a maximum of 100 frames, whose frame rate is 20 frames per second. 
3. Standards of good results:
    The motion is inside the scene's scope;
    The motion is near the target;
    The motion matches the semantics of the caption in the scene.
4. If the results are little different from the old "plan":
    If the motion tendency is "toward", keep the end frame information of the old "plan";
    If the motion tendency is "away", keep the start frame information of the old "plan";
5. Task Flow:
    First, determine whether all "results" relatively match the given captions and scenes under the mentioned requirements.
    If they do, directly set the old "plan" as the new "plan".
    If not, select the best sample from the "result" and correct its potential errors under the mentioned requirements.  
    Lastly, use this corrected "result" to generate a new "plan" in the same format.
Now I will provide you with all the information:
